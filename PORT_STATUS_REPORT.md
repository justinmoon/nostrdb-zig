# NostrDB Zig Port Status Report
*Updated: 2025-09-13*

## Current Status: Phase 3 COMPLETE ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ Completed Phases
- **Phase 0**: Setup complete (submodule, build.zig, C bindings)
- **Phase 1**: Core Database Tests (Tests 1-6) ‚úÖ
- **Phase 2**: Extended Filter Tests (Tests 7-11) ‚úÖ  
- **Phase 3**: Note Management Tests (Tests 12-15) ‚úÖ COMPLETE

### Phase 3 Achievements
- ‚úÖ NoteBuilder signing fully enabled (no more `enable_sign_tests` flag)
- ‚úÖ Fixed ARM64 alignment crash in sha256 (platform-specific config.h override)
- ‚úÖ All tests pass including tag iteration and packed IDs
- ‚úÖ Block parsing for URLs, hashtags, and bech32 mentions working

### Phase 3 Minor Cleanup Tasks (Optional)
From PORTING_PLAN_V5.md lines 236-245:
- Add invoice block parsing test (BLOCK_INVOICE) 
- Replace sleep/poll waits with deterministic subscription draining helper
- Tidy allocations in `query()` to avoid page_allocator usage

### ‚ùå Missing Major Features (Phases 4-6)

#### Phase 4: Profiles - NOT IMPLEMENTED
- No `ProfileRecord` struct
- No `get_profile_by_pubkey()` method
- No `search_profile()` text search functionality
- Missing tests 16-17

#### Phase 5: Async Subscriptions - NOT IMPLEMENTED  
- No `SubscriptionStream` or async/await support
- No `wait_for_notes()` future
- No automatic unsubscribe on drop
- Missing stream abstraction (tests 18-22)

#### Phase 6: Advanced - NOT IMPLEMENTED
- No custom filter callbacks with FFI
- No relay tracking (`NoteRelays`, `IngestMetadata`)
- No transaction isolation tests
- No platform-specific handling
- Missing tests 23-28

## üìä Feature Parity Analysis

### Public API Comparison
**Rust**: ~19 public methods  
**Zig**: ~8 public methods

### Missing Methods in Zig
- `process_event_with()` - relay metadata tracking
- `process_client_event()` - client event handling  
- `get_profile_by_key/pubkey()` - profile lookups
- `get_notekey_by_id()` - key lookups
- `get_profilekey_by_pubkey()` - profile key lookups
- `get_blocks_by_key()` - block retrieval
- `search_profile()` - text search
- `subscription_count()` - subscription management
- `unsubscribe()` - explicit unsubscribe

## üéØ Roadmap to Feature Parity

### 1. Complete Phase 3 Cleanup (1 day)
- Enable signing tests fully
- Add invoice block test
- Replace sleep/poll with deterministic helpers
- Fix query allocator usage

### 2. Implement Phase 4: Profiles (1 day)
- Add ProfileRecord struct and flatbuffers support
- Implement profile retrieval methods
- Add text search functionality
- Tests 16-17

### 3. Implement Phase 5: Async (2 days)
- Design Zig async pattern (no tokio equivalent)
- Add subscription streams
- Implement auto-cleanup on drop
- Tests 18-22

### 4. Implement Phase 6: Advanced (2 days)
- Custom filter callbacks (complex FFI)
- Relay tracking and metadata
- Platform-specific features
- Tests 23-28

## Test Coverage
- **Passing**: 19/28 tests (68%)
- **Phase 0-3**: 19/19 tests ‚úÖ 
- **Phase 4-6**: 0/9 tests ‚ùå

## üéØ Recommendations for Next Steps

### Option 1: Complete MVP+ (Recommended - 2 days)
Focus on the most useful missing features:
1. **Phase 4: Profiles** (1 day)
   - Add ProfileRecord struct
   - Implement `get_profile_by_pubkey()`
   - Add profile search functionality
   - Tests 16-17

2. **Minor Cleanups** (0.5 day)
   - Replace sleep/poll waits in tests
   - Add invoice block test
   - Clean up query allocator

### Option 2: Full Feature Parity (6-7 days)
Complete all remaining phases:
1. Phase 4: Profiles (1 day)
2. Phase 5: Async Subscriptions (2 days)
3. Phase 6: Advanced Features (2-3 days)
4. Cleanup tasks (0.5 day)

### Option 3: Ship MVP (0 days)
The current implementation is already usable:
- ‚úÖ Database operations work
- ‚úÖ Event ingestion and queries work
- ‚úÖ Note building and signing work
- ‚úÖ Filter system complete
- ‚úÖ Tag and block parsing work

You could ship now and add profiles/async later as needed.

## Technical Debt to Address
1. **Sleep/poll in tests**: Tests 3, 5, 6 use brittle timing - should be deterministic
2. **Query allocator**: Currently uses page_allocator, should use proper allocator
3. **Error handling**: Could be more granular than current Error enum

## Summary
**Phase 3 is COMPLETE!** The Zig port now has a fully functional note database with signing capabilities. The ARM64 alignment issue was solved elegantly in the build system without touching the submodule.

The most practical next step would be **Option 1**: Add profile support (Phase 4) which would give you a very complete and useful library. Async subscriptions (Phase 5) and advanced features (Phase 6) can be added incrementally as needed.
